# React + Wouter + Zustand
I've always liked *WouterJS*. I thought it was better than `react-router` and easier to use than `universal-router`. However, there's not many examples of wouter used on the web.

So, I created this repo to showcase how to use *Wouter* with protected routes, getting the location so as to display different text.

### HELP ME HELP OTHERS
I'm by no means a *Wouter* expert. If there are things you think I can improve upon, by all means, help me help others.

If you think I just suck...well, help me help others :-D no, seriously, help me!

### USING
This is a simple app, you must log in to see the `/items` route.

    #login credentials
    john
    abc123

I know it says *email* but, **john** is so much easier than **john@example.com**
